# **App Name**: Goldsmith Assistant

## Core Features:

- Dynamic Table UI: Implement a clean and user-friendly interface for the receipt page (page 2) with a dynamic table for item details, ensuring easy data entry and clear presentation of calculations (Net weight and Final weight).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#FFD700) to reflect the Goldsmith theme.
- Secondary color: Cream or off-white (#FFFDD0) for backgrounds to provide a soft, clean look.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements to provide contrast and highlight actions.
- Use a consistent grid layout for all pages to maintain visual structure and alignment.
- Use simple and elegant icons for the sidebar menu items, using a consistent style throughout the application.
