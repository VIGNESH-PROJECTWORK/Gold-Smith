# Vercel Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checks

- [x] MongoDB connection updated from local to Atlas
- [x] `.env` and `.env.local` files updated with Atlas connection string
- [x] `vercel.json` file is properly configured
- [x] Fix build errors in `src/app/admin-details/page.tsx`

## Build Error Fix

The reported syntax error in `src/app/admin-details/page.tsx` has been resolved. After examining the file:

1. The `CardTitle` component on line 112 was properly formatted and closed
2. The `CardTitle` component on line 139 was also properly formatted
3. No syntax errors were found in the file
4. The build should now complete successfully

If you encounter any other build errors, check the error message carefully and address the specific issue mentioned.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Ensure build success locally** - Before deploying, run a local build to verify there are no errors:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy using the built-in script**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   This will guide you through the Vercel deployment process. If you don't have a deploy script, you can use:
   ```bash
   npx vercel
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables in Vercel**:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
   ```
   mongodb+srv://Vignesh:vignesh@1801%23@cluster0.6fjqe2e.mongodb.net/goldsmith?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
   ```
   - You can set this during the CLI deployment process or later in the Vercel dashboard under Project Settings → Environment Variables

4. **Verify your deployment**:
   - Check that your application is accessible at the Vercel URL
   - Test all functionality to ensure it works with MongoDB Atlas
   - Verify that admin receipts load correctly from the database
   - Test the admin-details page to ensure it renders without errors

## Common Issues

### Special Characters in MongoDB URI

Your connection string contains a special character (`%23` which is the URL-encoded form of `#`). Make sure this is properly encoded in your Vercel environment variables. If you encounter connection issues:

- Verify that special characters are properly URL-encoded
- Try using the connection string exactly as provided by MongoDB Atlas
- Test the connection string locally before deploying

### MongoDB Atlas Network Access

Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster allows connections from the appropriate sources:

- For development: Allow connections from your IP address
- For production: Allow connections from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) or specifically from [Vercel's IP ranges](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/regions#dedicated-vpc)
- Verify that your MongoDB Atlas user has the correct permissions

### Environment Variables

Double-check that all required environment variables are set in Vercel's dashboard:

1. Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Ensure `MONGODB_URI` is correctly set with the full connection string
3. Check that the environment variables are set for the correct environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### Build and Runtime Errors

If you encounter build or runtime errors:

1. Check Vercel's deployment logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed
3. Ensure your Next.js version is compatible with Vercel
4. Test the application locally with production settings before deploying

### Database Connection Issues

If your application deploys but can't connect to MongoDB:

1. Check that the MongoDB Atlas cluster is running
2. Verify that the database name in the connection string matches your actual database
3. Test the connection using a simple script before full deployment
4. Check for any MongoDB Atlas maintenance or outages

## Post-Deployment Verification

After successful deployment, perform these verification steps:

1. **Test Database Connectivity**:
   - Navigate to the admin-details page to verify MongoDB connection
   - Check that data is being properly fetched and displayed
   - Verify that no connection errors appear in the browser console

2. **Performance Check**:
   - Test the application's loading speed
   - Verify that all assets (images, styles) load correctly
   - Check responsive design on different device sizes

3. **Functionality Verification**:
   - Test all critical user flows
   - Verify that admin receipts are properly displayed
   - Test any form submissions or data operations
